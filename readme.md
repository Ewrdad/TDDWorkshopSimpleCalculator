# TDD Workshop - A simple calculator

This is a simple workshop in how to develop using TDD comprising of a starting point and a example implementation

## Goal

Using TDD develop a simple react calculator that multiplies two numbers together and displays the result.

The base acceptance criteria(AC) )is:

- I must be able to input 2 numbers
- I must be able to see the product of those two numbers

## Starting Point

A template of a simple react project is given in `./template`

Before running anything else it will work you will need to run

```bash
npm install
```

To run tests use:

```bash
npm run test
```

to run the website:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Code can go in the main App.jsx component for simplicity.

## Example

The example can be found in `./example`. It is not the best implimentation but it is my example of how I do it.

Same commands as above for testing and running.

## What tools does this use?

This uses the following tools:

- Vite
- React
- Vitetest
- @testing-libary/react

There are other requirments in order to set these up but these are what you'll be interacting with.
